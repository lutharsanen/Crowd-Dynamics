    "<p> This notebook replicates the model from the paper. It's divided into three parts. In the weight calculation part, different weights for each agent is calculated. This weights describes the impact the other agents of the model has an a certain agent to join the loala wave. Neighbours on the left of the agent have a much bigger impacts than the others. The modelling part represents the actual model we built to replicate the paper. And in the evaluation part we replicated the plot of the results, which was shown in the paper to proof, that our model performs as well as the model in the paper. </p>"
